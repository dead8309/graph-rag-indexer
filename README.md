# grag indexer

mostly an experiment to see how fast I can index a large number of files and search them using graph rag and graph database and compare it to a traditional rag

# todo

parser - TODO: recheck this condition, we might also need small functions for indexing purposes they could help in rag maybe
parser - NOTE: maybe dynamic imports?, will have to check later
models - TODO: i'll have to rethink about this, requires can be also called inside functions (lazy loading)
